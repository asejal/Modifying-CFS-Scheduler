# Modifying-CFS-Scheduler
Modified CFS Scheduler by adding a soft real-time requirement for a process. Higher priority is given to processes with a soft real-time requirement. This modification is done by introducing a new parameter corresponding to the soft real-time requirement, implementing a system call which sets this parameter's value and modifying the selection process for the RB tree in a Linux system using Operating Systems concepts. This is tested through C code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description of Code
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have introduced a parameter called sruntime in the sched_entity struct present in the
task_struct struct in the linux kernel file sched.h. This sruntime refers to the soft runtime and
is the soft real time guarantee to be provided to the process. It is zero by default and can take
only positive values. General range of values is 108 - 109 since the time is taken in nanoseconds.
An example of valid value for this could be the integer 1,00,00,00,000. For a process with
sruntime equal to this, it will have higher priority over a process with 0 sruntime value and will
thus finish quicker without having to wait for processes with lower priority. Consider the case
of two processes, processA with sruntime = 10,00,00,000 and another processB with sruntime =
9,00,00,00,000. Here process B will have higher priority and thus will be executed before
process A which has lower priority considering their sruntime values.

In the fair.c file, which has the implementation of the CFS scheduler, I have added a few lines
to make sure the sruntime of the current process is also updated along with the other fields in
the update_curr function. The update_curr function is responsible for updating the current
taskʼs runtime statistics, updates the vruntime and now also sruntime, then calls
account_cfs_rq_runtime which in turn eventually calls resched_curr which will fix the red
black tree. In case the value of sruntime for current process is positive, we decrement it by
delta_exec or equate it to zero (whichever gives maximum non-negative value) which is the
time for which current process has run after the last update of its parameters.

I have also made changes in the entity_before function, which is responsible for returning
values 0 or 1 according to if sched_entity ʻaʼ and sched_entity ʻbʼ, its two parameters, ʻaʼ should
be scheduled before ʻbʼ. To make sure, sched_entity along with the already present check on
vruntime we also look at the sruntime values for them, I have added a few if-else statements
which return 1 if a has a higher value of sruntime than b and 0 otherwise. This is so because
higher value of sruntime means higher priority and that this process must be scheduled first
and thus move towards the left of the red black tree to be picked first. Thus the
pick_next_entity function which calls entity_before will now correctly choose the process with
higher soft real time requirements.

I have also made a system call called rtnice which takes two parameters, integer type pid and
integer type rtg (real time guarantee) and sets the sruntime value of the process with given pidto rtg. The implementation for this starts with a PID struct corresponding to the integer PID passed as parameter which is obtained using the find_get_pid function which takes the PID
(integer or pid_t type) as input. This PID struct is used to get the corresponding task_struct
which is a structure, an interface to the scheduler, used to store details of processes in the
linux kernel. This is done using the pid_task function which takes the pointer to the PID
structure and returns the corresponding task_struct for the process with the given pid. In case
no process with
given pid exists, an error number is returned accordingly.The task_struct has fields which
describe the process one of which is ʻseʼ of struct sched_entity type which is used to access
sruntime and change it from default value of zero to that as of rtg (second parameter of
syscall). The system call returns 0 on successful execution while it returns -1 on unsuccessful
termination and sets global variable errno to the error number specified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Expected Inputs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The user should give two parameters to the system call, the process PID and the real time
guarantee - both of integer type. The PID of the process should be valid for successful
execution of system call. The real time guarantee should be as defined in the first paragraph of
the description of the code section.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Expected Outputs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The system call returns 0 on successful execution and otherwise returns the error
number for the error and to which the global variable errno is also set. The interpretations of
the error number as described below. The error number and corresponding error messages
are printed using the perror in errno.h header file.
For comparing the real time guarantees for two processes, and proper working of the modified
scheduler, a test program test.c has been written which prints the time it took for a
computation (a large empty for loop in my case). This time has been fetched using the
gettimeofday() function which gives the exact time for the moment and it is stored in the struct
timeval. An empty for loop is run for some time after which the time is recorded again. The
difference between the start and end times tells the time the process took to complete the
execution which ideally should and mostly is lesser for the process with the soft real time
guarantees. This can be observed around 85 per cent of the time while in the rest of the cases,
we can safely assume that things like cache miss and page faults cause this. The CFS scheduler
thus, works properly if the time taken for the process with higher soft real time guarantee is
lesser as compared to that with lower soft real time guarantee.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Error Handling
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following errors are handled by the system call rtnice

1. Error 3  ESRCH3 /* No such process */
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This means that the process with given pid does not exist and thus its
corresponding task_struct can not be found by the kernel. Give PID of an
existing process to resolve the error.

2. Error 22 EINVAL 22 /* Invalid argument */
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All PIDs for processes are greater than 0 and have upper limit as pid_max value
which is used as a safe bound in the syscall implementation. If this error occurs
provide a value between o and 131072 to resolve it. This error can also occur if negative value
for soft real time requirements is given to a process. To rectify this, check that a valid value
(non-negative integer) has been given to the soft real time guarantee, the second parameter of
syscall.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing the System
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Three test files have been provided to check all cases for this modified scheduler.

1. test.c
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This checks the most basic functionality of the system, to check if a process with real
time requirements is given higher priority and executed before one with no such
requirements. The time taken for the latter which is the normal process should be less
than that for the former. Can be run using the ʻmake runʼ command on cmd in the
correct directory.

2. testrt.c
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This checks whether the process with lower real time guarantees is executed after one
with higher real time guarantees. Both processes have positive values of sruntime but
the one with greater value of sruntime shows lesser time taken.

3. testerr.c
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This does error handling of three types - invalid PID value, invalid soft real time
guarantee value and incorrect PID value (process does not exist). The error number and
corresponding error messages are printed using the perror in errno.h header file
